A few notes on unityIRC
This is the IRC that unity speaks of on its website on this page: http://udn.unity3d.com/
It is hosted at: irc.freenode.net on the #unity3d channel

--------------------------------------------
unityIRC connects directly to the main IRC of unity for all help questions.  Simply type in a display name and get to work!

--------------------------------------------
NOTE!!!
I spoke with they guys at support@unity3d.com and they told me the best method to keep everything working when pressing play
in the editor was to create a separate program to manage it.  When I get a chance to test this on Mac I will.

Because of this you will notice a console window appear, you are free to minimize it and just let it run in the background, it
will warn you of any errors and if it is closed you will be dis-connected.

--------------------------------------------
Helpful tips:
the name before the ">" at the beginning of a line is the sender
Yellow is the color when someone private messages you
Green is your messages that you send
White is general chat
Blue is server messages

--------------------------------------------
How to private message someone?
You can private message someone by typing:  !pvt theusername! and your message here

When you private message someone it will have their name in "~" to let you know that is the person you have private messaged.

Thank you for trying out unityIRC and don't forget to leave feedback and suggestions.
